## Pre-requisities

### DNS Domain
In order for the demo to work you need to have your DNS zone configured in Azure under a resource group called "f5demo_dns". This zone is used to register the F5 devices that will be created as well as provide a public FQDN for the apps that we will be publishing. 
Note: It is important that the Resource Group is called "f5demo_dns" as it is being used by terraform to make all the neccessary configurations.
